# snake-js #

This simple project demonstrates usages of different JS libraries to make a simple old-fashioned snake game.

It's not completed now and is just a hobby in my spare time. 

## To-Do ##

* Use [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/) to render game.
* Change the game to multiplayer.
* Add networking to multiplayer game.
